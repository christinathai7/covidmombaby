# Examination of Cord Blood at Birth in Women with SARS-CoV2 Exposure and/or Vaccination During Pregnancy and Relationship to Fetal Cortisol, Ferritin, Vitamin D, and CRP

This was a Marshall University study that was accepted into the Pediatric Academic Society 2022 conference. The study is looking at correlations between momâ€™s COVID vaccination status and maternal/neonatal outcomes, as well as COVID-specific antibodies. 

The dataset had some missing data within the CBC.

I evaluated for regression assumptions, then used multiple imputations by chained equations (MICE) by linear regression and predictive mean matching to fill in the missing data!
